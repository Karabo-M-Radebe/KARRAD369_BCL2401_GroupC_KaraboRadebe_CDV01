### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    Industries or roles I have researched:
    - junior developer - they provide assistance to support continuous improvement throughout the development life cycle of computer applications.
    - front-end developer - they ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page through the combination of design, technology and programming to code a  websiteâ€™s appearance, as well as taking care of debugging.

    Areas that piqued my interest:
    - Salary > during my research, the monetary aspect of the field of study seemed to grab my attention more often than not, and I realised that this imbued a sense of motivation to excel and learn even more than I already am.

    - Opportunity to improve and innovate > the concept of developing, fixing, or improving something has always intrigued me, and so learning that the role of a junior developer is pretty much that piqued my interest.

    - Opportunity to get creative > as a creative at heart, I resonate with the whole idea of designing web application and sites through code.

    - Opportunity to understand human-technology interaction better > the relationship between man and machine has always been one of continous improvement, through front-end development I get to learn how to improve layout so that it becomes easier to interact with apps and sites, and figure out how to better acquire the desired outcome (such as increasing the conversion rate of visitor to buyers)

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    Reflection on how these industries/roles align with my skills, interests, and values:
    Some of the skills I have gained so far and are yet to gain throughou the year are going to be extremely necessary to accomplish some of my career interests and goals. The technical skills that I will have when I graduate from Codespace will allow me to gain employment and essentially begin the journey to developing my skills and career. The roles that I have researched align very well with my values and interests as they will allow me to be innovative, creative, as well as continuosly learn and improve while collaborating with other valued team members. As a junior developer, I will have the opportunity to solve issues such as debugging, get creative in terms of front-end design, and also learn how to improve the integration of human and technology and their interaction. Being a front-end developer will afford me similar opportunities to find the alignment between the roles and my values and interests.

    Gaps or areas for further exploration:
    In terms of further exploration, I believe that I'm still discovering the world of software engineering and hope to  one day find that perfect match for me within the industry. I know that there is a lot more to learn, a lot more to experience, and a whole lot more to build and develop (skills and projects alike). The only gaps that I can find currently is building the necessary technical skills that I will require to make it into the industry and gain a competittive advantage. Another personal gap/area for further exploration would be my leadership skills and learning how to get comfortable in accepting such roles.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - SMART goals list

    Improve Problem-Solving Skills: I would like to solve a minimum of 50 problems coding challenges within the next six months on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, focusing on diverse topics by dedicating regular time to practice problem-solving, this goal will help enhance my coding skills and create synergy between my interests and values.
